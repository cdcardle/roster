Roster
======
This is a Sinatra project for a web application for sport coaches.  The coaches will create an account and then they can create teams and players for those teams.  They can also edit or delete teams and players as needed.  It's a great way to keep track of all the teams you coach.

## Installation
To install this project, first clone the repo to your terminal.
```
git clone git@github.com:cdcardle/roster.git
```

Then open that folder in your terminal and run:
```
bundle install
```

Now that the dependent gems are installed, run:
```
shotgun
```

Finally you can open your browser and go to the localhost address shotgun has given you.
